# Sophistry-Altium-Libraries
Database based libraries for Altium

In order to maintain consistency in the library all files should adhere to the following standards:

Footprints:
Every footprint will have it’s own file
Both the footprint library and the component will have the same name
All footprints will be generated by the IPC compliant footprint generator where possible. (Modifications after the fact are OK)
Origin will be defined on center.
The mechanical layers will be used as follows:
	Mechanical 1 -Leave blank. For board outline only
Mechanical 2 -Board Notes
	Mechanical 13 -3D body or step Top
Mechanical 14 -3D body or step Bottom Paired with above
	Mechanical 15 -2D Courtyard Top with center cross
	Mechanical 16 -2D Courtyard Bottom paired with above
	Mechanical 17 - RESERVED for ‘.Designator’ Top to be used instead or with silk when it works better
	Mechanical 18 - RESERVED for ’.Designator’ Bottom paired with above
	Mechanical 19 - RESERVED for ‘.Comment’ Top Optional assembly instructions
	Mechanical 20 -RESERVED for‘.Comment’ Bottom paired with above
All parts should have at least a 3D bounding body
Any part that can contact the user or enclosure should have a STEP body
Avoid thermal vias in footprints
Courtyard linewidth should be 0.05mm
Silkscreen linewidth should be  0.2mm

Symbols:
Every symbol will have it’s own file
Both the Symbol library and the component will have the same name
Symbols should contain no parameters (these should be pulled from the database)
Origin will be defined so that all pins are on grid (preferably top left pin)
Functional symbols are highly prefered to the physical symbols (ie pins grouped by function and signal flow and not necessarily ordered 1,2,3)
Make sure Tools>Document Options> Always Show Comment/Designator is checked
The description field should be referenced and will most commonly be ‘=PartNumber’ Do not use the value directly
Use standard Altium colors. Blue 229, Black 3, Red 227, Yellow 218 (IC boxes)
Make sure all parts are locked to prevent re-annotation errors
When drawing power blocks rails should have space to accommodate capacitors and a ground symbol (usually about 9 blocks)
Designators will have the following convention:
Resistors - R?
Capacitors - C?
Diodes and Bridge Rectifiers - D?
Inductors and Chokes - L?
Transformers - T?
Ferrite beads - FB?
Jacks and Connectors - J?
Integrated Circuits - U?
Switches - S?
Layout:
Silk screen should be 31 mils high and 6 mil wide for silk screen
Designators should have same orientation as components where possible.

Databases:
all DBs should be in excell 97 (.xls) for compatability
Follow Digikey where possible for easy orginization and matanance

Project Parameters:
** Still need to set these up**
